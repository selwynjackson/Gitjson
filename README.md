NodeRED json file converter

json files generated by NodeRED contain long lines with '\n' sequences embedded.  
This makes it difficult to compare versions using Git.

The Gitjson converts all "\n" text sequences to '\n>>\t\t' so that it is easy to view differences in files.  
The same utility can unconvert the files back to the original format.

When running the utility without arguments, the use of the utility is shown:
```
Gitjson - Version 1.0 - Convert NodeRED json for use by Git and vica versa
Text '\n' is converted to 'LF >> tab tab'
Use: Gitjson <sourcefile.json> <destinationfile>
     Gitjson <sourcefile.json> - to convert to sourcefile.gitjson
     Gitjson <sourcefile.gitjson> - to unconvert to sourcefile.json
     Gitjson <flows*.json> to convert to <project><label.gitjson> - where label is extracted from json file
     Gitjson /p <project> - to set project directory
     Gitjson /p - to clear project directory
Project is currently set to 'D:\GitWork\NodeRED\'
```
The project is useful for moving the json file from the downloads directory directly into the project directory, 
with the flows*.json filename converted to the first label in the json file.
